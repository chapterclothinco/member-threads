                <p>Member Threads is part of the <a href="https://gostitched.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: var(--terracotta); font-weight: 600;">Stitched</a> family — the same manufacturing capabilities, the same team, the same commitment to quality. But with a specific focus: creating custom apparel for groups and communities who deserve better than generic merchandise.</p>

                <p>We started Member Threads because we kept hearing the same story from nonprofits, clubs, and organizations: they wanted gear their members would actually wear, not just another logo slapped on a cheap tee. They wanted something that represented their community, their mission, their identity.</p>

                <p>So that's what we do. We manufacture custom apparel from scratch — designing original artwork, selecting premium materials, and producing gear that looks and feels like it came from a real brand. Because it did. Yours.</p>
